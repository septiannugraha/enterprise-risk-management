## Steps to push this repository to GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/new

   - Description: "Enterprise Risk Management System - Comprehensive web-based platform for ISO 31000:2018 compliant risk management"
   - Make it PUBLIC (for portfolio)
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. **Push your code**
   ```bash
   cd /home/septiannugraha/code/enterprise-risk-management
   
   # Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/enterprise-risk-management.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **After pushing, update your Upwork/LinkedIn**
   - Add this as a pinned repository
   - Update the startup application with this link
   - Reference in proposals: "Built complete ERM system: github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/enterprise-risk-management"
